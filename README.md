## ðŸ“– Introduction

![](asset/BDINR.png)

Restoring motion from blur is a challenging task due to the inherent ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, the intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and the diverse motions present in natural videos. In this work, by leveraging classical coded exposure imaging technique and emerging implicit neural representation for videos, we tactfully embed the motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process and develop a novel self-recursive neural network to sequentially retrieve the latent video sequence from the blurry image utilizing the embedded motion direction cues.
